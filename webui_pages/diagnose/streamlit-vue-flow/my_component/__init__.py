# that is used to create instances of the component. We're naming this
# function "_component_func", with an underscore prefix, because we don't want
# to expose it directly to users. Instead, we will create a custom wrapper
# function, below, that will serve as our component's public API.

# It's worth noting that this call to `declare_component` is the
# *only thing* you need to do to create the binding between Streamlit and
# your component frontend. Everything else we do in this file is simply a
# best practice.

# output value, and add a docstring for users.
