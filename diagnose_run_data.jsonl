This could be due to a sudden increase in the volume of the data being handled, or a lack of optimization in the data insertion process. When too much data is inserted into a database in a short span of time, it can cause a spike in disk reads, indicating a high level of data retrieval activity. This could potentially slow down the overall performance of the database as the system struggles to keep up with the increased demand.\n\n- **High Disk Reads**: The high disk reads could be a result of the aforementioned high volume data insertion. Disk reads refer to the process of retrieving data from a disk. High disk reads can indicate that the database is frequently accessing the disk to read data, which can considerably slow down its performance. This, coupled with the high volume data insertion, could lead to an overutilization of the database resources, thereby causing the anomaly.\n\n- **Space Insufficiency**: The large amount of data insertion could also lead to space insufficiency. Databases have a finite amount of storage space. When too much data is inserted, it can fill up this space, leading to a lack of sufficient storage for new data. This could potentially lead to data loss, and even system crashes if not managed properly.\n\nIn conclusion, the root cause of the anomaly seems to be a combination of high volume data insertion, high disk reads, and space insufficiency.", "time": "17:08:52", "sender": "ConfigurationExpert"}, {"data": "Here are the potential solutions:\n\n1. **Optimize the data insertion process**: Streamline the process of data insertion into your database.

This can be done through various database management tools.

The workload query indicates a high volume of data insertion into table1, which could be causing the disk read issues and space insufficiency. For optimization, the work_mem parameter adjustment could be beneficial as it is used in operations such as ORDER BY, DISTINCT, and merge joins. However, before proceeding to the solution, I think it would be beneficial to check if the index selection is optimized.<br><details open><summary><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; color: #333333\">using Tools:</span></summary><div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; line-height: 36px\"><div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-content: center\"><div style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #333333; width: 160px; flex-shrink: 0\">Command Name:</div><div style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #676c90!important;\">optimize_index_selection</div></div><div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-content: center\"><div style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #333333; width: 160px; flex-shrink: 0\">Arguments:</div><div style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #676c90!important; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"{\\\"start_time\\\": \\\"2023-10-15 09:17:49\\\",\\\"end_time\\\": \\\"2023-10-15 09:23:49\\\"}\"</div></div><div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-content: center\"><div style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #333333; width: 160px; flex-shrink: 0\">Command Status:</div><div style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #676c90!important;\">Success</div></div></div></details>\nObservation: Recommended indexes:\nThought: It seems there are no additional indexes recommended for optimization.

High IO can be caused by user statements that result in excessive physical reads.

If the difference between these two fields is high, it indicates a high number of physical reads. Additionally, the \\'wait status\\' and \\'wait event\\' fields in the pg_thread_wait_status view can be checked to see if there are any IO-related events or data file reads. The dhe_perf_local_active_session/gs_asp views can also be queried to check for records with Query events related to \\'IO EVENT/DataFileRead\\' during a specific time period. Slow SQL queries with a high difference in \\'n blocks fetched\\' and \\'n blocks hit\\' fields or high data IO time can also indicate high IO.

This is a function that analyzes various features related to SQL execution and returns a feature vector, system cause details, and suggestions. The features include lock contention, heavy scan operator, abnormal plan time, unused and redundant index, and many others. The function checks if each feature can be obtained and appends the feature value to the feature vector. If a feature cannot be obtained, it logs an error message and appends 0 to the feature vector. The function also sets the system cause and plan details to empty dictionaries.
